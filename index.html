							<p> As a child, Elon found an interest in computer programming. After teaching himself BASIC, he coded Blastar. A magazine named <i>PC and Office Technology</i> purchased the code for $500 when he was 12 years old. </p>

						<p>Seeing America as the land of opportunity to work on his bold ideas, Elon first moved to Canada with help from his mother's canadian citizenship.</p>
						<p>He spent the first two years of his undergraduate career at Queen's University in Canada which he regards as a formative time in his life.</p>
						<p>After 2 years, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania to complete a Bachelor's of Science in physics and economics.</p>

						<p>After graduating, Elon briefly considered doing a PhD program in applied physics at Stanford before deciding to pursue his entrepreneurial interests in the internet.</p>

						<p>He decided to go into business with his brother, Kimbal, and 4 others to build useful things on the internet.</p>

						<p>In 1999, his first company Zip2, was acquired by Compaq for $307 million. Musk received $22 million</p>

						<p>After the success of Zip2, Elon co-founded paypal (Initially named X.com) with $10 million.</p>
						<p>The goal was to create a secure platform for payments online. Initial growth was through viral marketing by giving users $10 on sign up and $10 for each friend they brought onto the platform.</p>
						<p>Due to disagreements within the company, Elon was ousted as CEO. By 2001, Paypal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion netting him $165 million. The capital necessary to pursue his largest dreams.</p>

						<p>Elon's inital plan was to fund a mission to Mars called "Mars Oasis" to reignite the public interest in space flight.</p>
						<blockquote><p>"I started with a crazy idea to spur the national will. I called it the Mars Oasis missions. The idea was to send a small greenhouse to the surface of Mars, packed with dehydrated nutrient gel that could be hydrated on landing. You'd wind up with this great photograph of green plants and red background — the first life on Mars, as far as we know, and the farthest that life's ever travelled. It would be a great money shot — plus, you'd get a lot of engineering data about what it takes to maintain a little greenhouse and keep plants alive on Mars. If I could afford it, I figured it would be a worthy expenditure of money, with no expectation of financial return."</p>
						<p> In an interview with Wired Magazine</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p>This initial plan turned into a rocket company when Elon was unable to secure a rocket at a reasonable price for the mission. After doing the math, Musk realized that there was opportunity to significantly lower the cost of space travel while still making a profit.</p>
						<p>With a team of experienced people and rocket engineers in the aerospace industry, SpaceX began work on the Falcon 1 to prove they could build rockets to the world.</p>
						<p>After countless setbacks and failures including a near bankruptcy, the Falcon 1 succeeded.</p>
						<p>Since then, SpaceX has successfully launched satellites into space, ran ressuply missions to the ISS (International Space Station), and landed the first stage of it's Falcon 9 rocket back onto earth. These are historical achievements for space exploration and the future of humanity.</p>
						<p>This is only the beginning with the companies long term aspirations to establish a colony on Mars.</p>

						<p>With an unwavering belief that electric cars could reach and surpass the performance of gasoline powered cars, Tesla Motors was born.</p>
						<p>Tesla's first car was the Tesla Roadster. The car was meant to prove to the world that electric cars could compete with the best luxury performance vehicles currently available.</p>
						<p>With the success of the first car, Tesla began production of its Model S Sedan and afterwards, the Model X SUV.</p>
						<p>It's last currently announced car is the Model 3. With an affordable price, high safety ratings, and high performance, the Model 3 is supposed to be the game changer for electric cars in the eyes of the general public.</p>
						<p>Not only does Tesla manufacture high quality cars, it has built a charging infrastructure to allow you the freedom to travel around the world.</p>

						<p>With an underlying motivation to slow gloabl warming, Elon helped co-found Solar City with his cousins.</p>
						<p>Not only does the solar panel manufacturer have an opportunity to make a large impact on the environment, Elon also has plans to incorporate it into his other businesses.</p>
						<p>He envisions a future where the home is powered by solar energy and the cars are charged by the same source.</p>

						<p>Elon has expressed strong opinions about the development of Artificial Intelligence in the past.</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p>“I think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence. If I had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is, it’s probably that. So we need to be very careful,” said Musk. “I’m increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight, maybe at the national and international level, just to make sure that we don’t do something very foolish.”</p>
							<p>In an interview at AeroAstro Centennial Symposium at MIT</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p>He has taken the initiative to help fund AI researchers to push the technology forward to benefit humanity without the pressure of becoming profitable.</p>
